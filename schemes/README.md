# üõ†Ô∏è Robot Schematic Diagram

This repository contains the schematic diagram and system overview for a simple Raspberry Pi 4-powered robot. The design features two DC motors, camera input, and remote power management, making it ideal for basic robotics experiments and computer vision applications.

## üîß Hardware Components

- **2√ó DC Motors**
  - One motor for **steering**
  - One motor for **driving**

- **Motor Driver: L298N Dual H-Bridge**
  - Handles both motors
  - Controlled via GPIO pins from the Raspberry Pi

- **Power Supply**
  - **9V Battery** powers the motors through the L298N
  - An **On/Off toggle switch** is placed between the battery and L298N for motor control
  - **Raspberry Pi 4** is powered separately using a **USB-A to USB-C cable** connected to a power bank

- **Controller: Raspberry Pi 4**
  - Runs the robot's control logic
  - **Pi Camera** connected via the flat ribbon cable for vision tasks
